        <h3>Why do this page exist?</h3>
        <p>
          To provide a rough draft for my work. I want to prove to myself that I
          can create, maintain, and provide value to things found on the
          internet.
        </p>
        <p>In the future I will create dynamic and compelling webpages.</p>
        <p>
          In the future I will build and maintain the infrastructure of websites
          and domains for clients and customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future I will provide value to the teams, individuals, and
          companies I align with.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are going to serve as my basic principles and goals to guide me
          throughout my career.
