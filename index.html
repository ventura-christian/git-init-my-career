          To provide a rough draft for my work. </p>
          <p>
            I want to prove to myself that I
            can crea
            
            te, maintain, and provide value to things found on the
            internet.

          <ul>

              In the future I will create dynamic and compelling webpages.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the future I will build and maintain the infrastructure of websites and domains for clients and customers.
